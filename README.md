## Aim of the project

My goal from this project is to try a simple MERN stack project. The project shows books and other related data, that data is stored on MongoDB, and pushed via Expressjs to the client that uses React.


## To run it directly

Go to the backend folder
Go to the frontend folder

```shell
cd frontend 
npm install
npm run dev
```

- add configuration of your database in comfig.js in the backend folder
- add IP address in MongoDB network configuration


## Step by Step realization of the project (to implement it from scratch)

- create a backend and frontend folders

- add .gitignore file

- run ```npm init -`y` inside the backend folder to initialize package.json file

- modify the package.json file

- run ```node i express nodemon```

- ```npm i cors```

- frontend: 
```shell
cd frontend
 
npm i react-router-dom

npm i axios react-icons```

npm i notistack
```

## Tips

```rface``` in VS Code to create a component (ES7 + React ...)
