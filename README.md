## Aim of the project

My goal from this project is try a simple MERN stack project. The project shows books and other related data, that data is stored on MongoDB, pushed via Expressjs to the client that uses React.


## To run it directly

Go to backend folder

```shell
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Go to frontend folder

```shell
cd frontend 
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Step by Stem realization of the project (to implememt it from scratch)

- create a backend and frontend folders

- add .gitignore file

- run ```npm init -y``` inside backend folder to initialize package.json file

- modify the package.json file

- run ```node i express nodemon```

- ```npm i cors```

- frontend: 
```shell
cd frontend
 
npm i react-router-dom

npm i axios react-icons```

npm i notistack```
- 
#
```
## Tips

-  ```rface``` in vscode to to create a component (ES7 + React ...)
